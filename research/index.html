    <div class="box_show">
        <div class="box-inner">This paper examines an environment where the Phillips curve is locally quite flat and in which a cost channel of monetary policy may also be at play. The aim of the paper is two fold. First, we highlight conditions under which a relatively flat  Phillips Curve  can invalidate standard prescriptions regarding how monetary policy should be conducted to control inflation. In particular, we discuss the desirability of   a "Go Big or Stay Home" principle for monetary policy under a certain parameter configuration. This principle refers to the desirability of either responding to shocks in a very aggressive way or  not at all, if one aims is to maintain inflation close to target. In the second part of the paper we explore the empirical relevance of the parameter configuration that would favor this principle. To this end,  we provide structural estimates from full model estimation as well as provide evidence based on more direct estimation of the Phillips curve.  The results from both exercises give  substantial support to the configuration of interest.  We use the framework to offer an explanation to recent puzzles associated the behavior of inflation including the possibility of falling into a low inflation trap.

	<pubf>Submitted</pubf></h2>
    <div class="box">
        <div class="box-inner">In this paper, I propose a flexible non-parametric method using Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) to estimate the dynamic structure of most expectation formation models in macroeconomics. This approach does not rely on restrictive assumptions of functional forms and parametric methods but nests the standard approaches of empirical studies on expectation formation. Applying this approach to data on macroeconomic expectations from the Michigan Survey of Consumers(MSC) and a rich set of signals available to U.S. households, I find qualitatively new results: (1) agents' expectations about the future economic condition have asymmetric and non-linear responses to signals; (2) agents' attentions shift from signals about the current state to signals about future: they behave as if they were adaptive learners in ordinary periods and become forward-looking as the state of economy gets worse; (3) the content of signals on economic condition, rather than the volume of these signals, plays the most important role in creating the attention-shift. My method also allows me to apply the Double Machine Learning method to assess the statistical significance of these empirical findings. Finally, I show these stylized facts can be generated by a model with rational inattention, in which information endogenously becomes more valuable when economic status gets worse.

    <div class="box">
        <br><div class="box-inner"> The goal of this paper is twofold.  We begin by re-examining the relative role of labour market tightness versus inflation expectation in driving inflation in the US, with a particular focus on the last few years. Our explorations points to a Phillips curve has been quite stable for over 50 years, with inflation almost entirely driven by short run inflation expectations, with labour market tightness playing a very marginal role.  We then explore the determination of short run inflation expectations.  Here we emphasize the role of broad-based supply shocks in driving inflation expectations.  In particular, we provide theory and evidence to support the notion that broad-based supply shocks are easily confused with pure inflation shocks, and this creates a signal extraction problem facing agents.   When agents see the prices of many goods increase, they infer that part of the increase reflects pure inflation and this becomes self-fulfilling.  In contrast, when inflation is driven by increases in a small number of price changes-- for example large increases in gas prices-- agents are not confused and accordingly, this does not propagate into persistent inflation.  The role of monetary policy in such an environment is to convince agents that pure inflation shocks are unlikely.

    <br><h2 type="button" class="slide-toggle">Uncovering Subjective Models from Survey Expectations</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <div class="box-inner">Expectations about different macroeconomic aspects correlate with each other. Using Michigan Survey of Consumers (MSC), I found consumers' inflation expectation is positively correlated with expectations on unemployment status. Such a correlation is inconsistent with realized data, professionals' belief, and the standard New Keynesian Model. I then perform a structural test in the framework of noisy information model and show that consumers form their expectations on multiple macroeconomic variables jointly rather than independently, thus causing these expectations to be correlated with each other. These results imply the consumers have a subjective model about how macroeconomics variables are correlated that is different from the professionals and the reality. In particular, consumers believe economic conditions will be worse during episode with extensive inflation news, even if there's only mild inflation, causing their average expectation on inflation to co-move with that of unemployment and business condition. These patterns call for explanations on how agents form beliefs on interactions between macroeconomic variables that are different from the actual structure of data. They also suggest Central Bank should use inflation-related expectation management policy with cautious, as such policy may induce pessimistic responses among households.

        <div class="box-inner">India witnessed a sharp wage catch-up by the historically disadvantaged scheduled castes
and tribes (SC/STs) towards non-SC/ST levels during the period 1983-2012. We provide a
structural explanation for the catch-up, using a multi-sector, heterogenous agent model where
individuals differ in ability as well as their caste identity. Castes differ in the costs of schooling
and accessing sectoral labor markets which results in caste-based talent misallocations. We show
that exogenous productivity growth can explain 72 percent of the observed wage convergence.
As in the data, education convergence is the primary driver of the wage convergence in the
model. We provide independent evidence in support of this mechanism.

        <br><div class="box-inner">Over the past three decades India and China have experienced rapid growth and structural transformation. Underneath this similarity however was one significant difference: rural-urban wage gaps declined in India, but widened in China. In both countries, the majority of these wage dynamics are unexplained by worker attributes. We formalize a two-sector-two-location model in which structural transformation and urbanization respond endogenously to productivity shocks. While the structural transformation effect widens the urban-rural wage gap, the urbanization effect reduces it. We attribute the contrasting wage gap dynamics in the two countries to the higher costs of urban relocation for workers in China.
