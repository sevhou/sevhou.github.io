	<h2>Learning and Subjective Expectation Formation: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach</h2>
		<p class="light-text">JOB MARKET PAPER</p>
		<p>Empirical studies on expectation formation in macroeconomics usually rely on assumptions of 
			functional forms and parametric methods. I propose a flexible non-parametric method, 
			Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), that can maintain the dynamic structure adopted by most 
			expectation formation models in macroeconomics. This approach allows me to approximate the 
			functional form of the expectation formation model and estimate average marginal effects of 
			signals on expectation using Double Machine Learning method.

			<br><br>
			 Applying this approach to survey expectations for U.S. households and a rich set of signals 
			available to them, I find: (1) agents' expectations about the future economic condition have 
			asymmetric and non-linear response to signals; (2) agents attention shift from signals about 
			the current state to signals about future: they are adaptive learners in ordinary periods and 
			become forward looking as state of economy gets worse; (3) the content of signals on economic 
			condition, rather than volume of these signals, plays the most important role in creating the 
			attention-shift. I then show these stylized facts can be generated by a model with rational 
			inattention, in which information is more valuable when economic status gets worse.

	<h2>Monetary Policy when the  Phillips Curve is locally quite flat</h2>
		<p class="light-text">Joint with Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, CEPR Discussion Papers No. DP15184</p>
		<p>This papers examines an environment where the Phillips curve is locally quite flat and in which 
			a cost channel of monetary policy may also be at play.  The aim of the paper is two fold.  
			First, we highlight conditions under which a relatively flat  Phillips Curve  can invalidate 
			standard prescriptions regarding how monetary policy should be conducted to control inflation.    
			In particular, we discuss the desirability of   a "Go Big or Stay Home" principle for monetary 
			policy under a certain parameter configuration. This principle refers to the desirability of 
			either responding to shocks in a very aggressive way or  not at all, if one aims is to maintain 
			inflation close to target. In the second part of the paper we explore the empirical relevance 
			of the parameter configuration that would favor this principle.  To this end,  we provide 
			structural estimates from full model estimation as well as provide evidence based on more 
			direct estimation of the Phillips curve.  The results from both exercises give  substantial 
			support to the configuration of interest.  We use the framework to offer an explanation to 
			recent puzzles associated the behavior of inflation including the possibility of falling 
			into a low inflation trap.

	<h2>Uncovering Subjective Models from Survey Expectations</h2>
		<p>Expectations about different macroeconomic aspects correlate with each other. I perform a structural 
			test in framework of noisy information model and show that individual forms their expectations on 
			multiple macroeconomic variables jointly rather than independently, thus causing these expectations 
			to be correlated with each other. In particular, they have a subjective model about the economy. 
			They believe economic conditions will be worse during episode with extensive inflation news, even 
			if there's only mild inflation, causing their average expectation on inflation to co-move with that 
			of unemployment and business condition. To alleviate the concern of possible mis-specification of 
			linear noisy information model, I then propose an innovative generic learning model that can cover a 
			large class of expectation formation models, including those are standard in the literature. The 
			effect of signals on expectational variables is estimated with Recurrent Neural Network. I found
			again realized inflation increase household's perceived future unemployment rate change whereas 
			actual unemployment rate hike will lower their expected inflation. The pessimistic effect of 
			inflation is not because of household's belief on interest rate and is particularly strong after 
			late 1990s. These patterns call for explanations on how agents form beliefs on interactions between 
			macroeconomic variables that are different from the actual structure of data. They also suggest 
			Central Bank should use inflation-related expectation management policy with cautious, as such 
			policy may induce pessimistic responses among households.
