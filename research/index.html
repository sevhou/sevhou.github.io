	<h2>Paper 1: Learning and Subjective Expectation Formation: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach</h2>
		<p class="light-text">JOB MARKET PAPER</p>
		<p>Households are exposed to a rich set of signals that can help them form expectations. 
			How they make use of these signals remain a debated question among economists. 
			To answer this question, standard learning models typically have trouble to capture 
			the rich interactions between signals and potential non-linearity in expectation 
			formation process due to rational inattention, subjective beliefs or other behavioural 
			reasons that may be unknown to researcher. This paper tackles the problem by proposing 
			a generic learning model that can cover a large class of expectation formation models, 
			including those are standard in the literature. The effect of signals on expectational 
			variables then is obtained by approximating the conditional expectation function with 
			an innovative semi-parametric approach: Recurrent Neural Network. 
			<br><br>
			Applying this approach to survey expectations for U.S. households, I find: (1) agents' 
			perceptions about future have asymmetric and non-linear response to signals with different 
			contents; (2)the weights they apply on public signals in the learning model are highly 
			state-dependent and differ in boom and recession episodes; (3) the intensity of media reports 
			affect the weight put on public signals, more media reports on one aspect of the economy 
			decrease agents' reliance on corresponding public signals. I then propose a model that 
			features rational inattention to explain these patterns.</p>

	<h2>Paper 2: Monetary Policy when the  Phillips Curve is locally quite flat</h2>
		<p class="light-text">CO-AUTHOR: Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier</p>
		<p>This papers examines an environment where the Phillips curve is locally quite flat and in which 
			a cost channel of monetary policy may also be at play.  The aim of the paper is two fold.  
			First, we highlight conditions under which a relatively flat  Phillips Curve  can invalidate 
			standard prescriptions regarding how monetary policy should be conducted to control inflation.    
			In particular, we discuss the desirability of   a "Go Big or Stay Home" principle for monetary 
			policy under a certain parameter configuration. This principle refers to the desirability of 
			either responding to shocks in a very aggressive way or  not at all, if one aims is to maintain 
			inflation close to target. In the second part of the paper we explore the empirical relevance 
			of the parameter configuration that would favor this principle.  To this end,  we provide 
			structural estimates from full model estimation as well as provide evidence based on more 
			direct estimation of the Phillips curve.  The results from both exercises give  substantial 
			support to the configuration of interest.  We use the framework to offer an explanation to 
			recent puzzles associated the behavior of inflation including the possibility of falling 
			into a low inflation trap.
